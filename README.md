# 📋 Academic Directory Manager

A **Java Swing-based GUI application** for **automatically managing semester and course folders** for organized academic workflow, ensuring consistent, clutter-free file structures without manual setup.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Semester Management**: Create and manage semesters dynamically.
- ✅ **Course Management**:
  - Enter course name and code.
  - Choose type:
    - *With Lab* (creates `Lectures`, `Labs`, and appopriate sub-folders).
    - *Without Lab* (creates `Assignments`, `Notes`)
    - Creates consistent folder structures automatically under the configured base directory.
- ✅ **View Existing Courses** under each semester.
- ✅ **Open Course Folders** directly in the system file explorer.
- ✅ **Delete Course Folders** safely with confirmation.
- ✅ Loads **base directory automatically** from `assets/path.txt`.
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatible.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Java 17+**
* **Swing** for GUI
* **Shell Script (`run.sh`)** for build automation

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AcademicDirectoryManager.git
cd AcademicDirectoryManager
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Base Directory

- Edit `assets/path.txt`
- Add the **full absolute path** where you want your semester and course folders to be managed, e.g.:

```
C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Academics
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

Make `run.sh` executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This will:

* Compile Java files from `src/` to `build/`
* Run the application from the compiled classes

## ⚙️ Future Enhancements

* Export semester & course listings to **CSV** for tracking.
* File count summary for each course.
* Dark mode toggle for GUI.
* Integrate `.jar` packaging for one-click running.
* Optional JavaFX migration for a modernized UI.
